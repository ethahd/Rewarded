## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Fetching location using CoreLocation and managing async updates without duplication of state/value
- Backend logic matching business categories with various card reward categories  
- Ordering and applying animations and transitions for a smooth and seamless experience
- Determing when to use `@Query`, `@State`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@Binding` properties to manage dynamic updates from different areas of app  
- Feeding location results to FourSquare Places API and making REST calls in a reactive UI loop

## Future Goals

- Accesibility support
- Add a settings tab to allow the user to:

  Choose units of display (miles, kilometers, etc.)

  Set distance radius (search for businesses within 1 mile, 5 miles, etc.)
- MapView of nearby businesses
- Add a detailed BusinessItemView for each business within user's location radius:

  View photo/logo of the business (fetching from API)

  View location (map view relative to user location)

  View rating of business (from yelp or google maps)

  View rewards for all cards in wallet at each business with applicable rewards categories highlighted
- Add support for more cards and dynamically fetching rewards categories/values

  Fetch rotating offers for cards and display offer if matched to business
- More rigorous reward calculation for loosely defined categories

  For example, a category of type 'Coffee Shop' should also be recognized as a Restaurant
- Polish UI flow

  Allow user to create account

  Polish welcome screen

  Allow user to filter types of businesses displayed
